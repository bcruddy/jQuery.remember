##Forget Me Not Forms

Users won't ever have to fill out a form twice again while maintaining full control of their data until THEY submit it.

FMNFs use HTML5 localStorage to store the values of forms until the form is submitted. On a successful submission, FMNFs automatically clears the users localStorage to prevent confusion in the future.

##Usage:
Forgetmenot assumes you'll be processing forms with AJAX so you'll need to uncomment this line and include an endpoint.
