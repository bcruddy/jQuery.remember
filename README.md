##jQuery.remember

Stores user form input in local storage until the form is submitted successfully. Allow users to return to unfinished forms and prevent form data loss when an error occurs on form submission.

###Example
Clone the repository and run `bower install` to hook up the example's dependencies and you can use a simple python server to check it out (`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`). Note that the actual AJAX call on the form submission has been commented out and there is no endpoint for the example to reach. Which is good because the python simple server doesn't actually support post requests.
